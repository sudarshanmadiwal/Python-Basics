The owners of a cafe in Pakistan received severe hate online after a video surfaced on social media that showed two women mocking the manager of the eatery for his English-speaking skills. 
Journalist Raza Ahmad Rumi posted the clip on Twitter and described the incident as "sad", and also applauded the manager for "putting up with this".
The video begins with Uzma and Dia - owners of Cannoli by Cafe Soul in Islamabad - introducing themselves, seated at a table in the restaurant. 
"We were bored, so we would like to introduce you to our team," Uzma said as she summoned Owais, the manager of the eatery.
